# Air-pollution-clustering

👋 Hi, I’m @ArtemRamus 👀 I’m interested in data science, machine learing & deep learning. 🌱 I’ve finished a project: "Clustering of air pollution". This project is based on a public dataset where air pollution in India listed concentrayion of three main pollutant in cities. Using feature engineering and machine learning techniques divided the dataset to three meaningful categories. 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on analysing datasets and making predictions. 📫 It is easy to reach me by email artem.ramus@gmail.com
